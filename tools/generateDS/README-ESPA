The files in this directory were originally developed by Dave Kuhlman.
See the LICENSE file.

The original files copied from version 2.12b are:
    generateDS.py
    process_includes.py
    README
    LICENSE

Each of the above files has been extracted from the orignal source tarball,
and are all that are required to generate the python data structures that we
need from our XML schema.  The original distribution contains a bunch of crap
that is not required and seems to be for other things, such as django hooks.
However, some files that maybe imported into generateDS.py have not been
copied over simply because we do not have an XML schema that uses them, or we
are not using those command line options.
