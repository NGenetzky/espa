This is the directory to hold all automated tests for espa.
October 25, 2013
Added sir.sh, si.sh, t.sh and t_ll.sh
    - sir.sh tests spectral indice reprojection and subsetting (albers)
    - si.sh tests only spectral indice generation 
    - t.sh tests reprojection and subsetting of normal LEDAPS outputs (albers)
    - t_ll.sh tests reprojection and subsetting of normal LEDAPS outputs into geographic
    - These need to be formalized and commented. Paths also need to be changed to point to the actual source file locations on edclpdsftp.
    - This is just the initial capture of the scripts.
    - Other tests should be added to account for all product permutations
        - normal lndsr generation
        - normal lndcal generation
        - normal lndth generation
        - normal spectral indice generation
        - standalone cfmask generation
        - lndsr with projection into albers, geographic and sinusoidal
        - lndcal with projection into albers, geographic and sinusoidal
        - lndth with projection into albers, geographic and sinusoidal
        - spectral indice with projection into albers, geographic and sinusoidal
        - lndsr, lndcal, lndth and si for subsetting/reframing
        - lndsr, lndcal, lndth and si for pixel resizing.
