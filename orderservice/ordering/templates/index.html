	<h4>Welcome to the ESPA Ordering Interface</h4>

        <p>This is the LDCM Science R&amp;D (LSRD) ESPA Ordering Interface, 
        allowing you to upload scenes and request any available level of 
        processing free of charge.  Keep in mind that all processing provided by
         LSRD is strictly for evaluation purposes only: The processing outputs 
        may be considered possible candidates for standard products in the 
        future.
        </p>
        <p>Current available processing includes surface reflectance for 
        applicable Landsat 5 TM and 7 ETM+ via Ledaps.  In the future, 
        additional processing will be available for evaluation including: T1 - 
        River Discharge, T2 - Water Use, T3 - Ground Water, T4 - Lake Levels, T5
         - Snow Cover, T6 - Glaciers and Ice Caps, T7 - Permafrost and 
        Seasonally Frozen Ground, T8 - Albedo, T9 - Land Cover, T10 - fAPAR, T11
         - Leaf Area Index, T12 - Biomass, T13 - Fire Disturbance, and finally 
        Soil Moisture (Emerging ECV).
        </p>
        <p>Land Surface Temperature is another Climate Data Record planned to be offered through ESPA</p>
